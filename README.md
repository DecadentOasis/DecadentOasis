DecadentOasis
=============

Decadent oasis visuals code

***

The way this works is the code under [src/](https://github.com/robot-head/DecadentOasis/tree/master/src) is an Eclipse Java project that will contain 99.999% of the code.  The DecadentShow class will have all of our patterns, modulators, and UI automation configured inside it, so we can edit it in a sane IDE.

The [DecadentOasisProcessingSketch folder](https://github.com/robot-head/DecadentOasis/tree/master/DecadentOasisProcessingSketch) contains the processing sketch with 0.01% remaining code.  I tried to put the rest of this code inside something that extends from PApplet, but I was geting all kinds of OpenGL errors :(
